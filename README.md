# ofxLiveSet

## Description
ofxLiveSet is an openframeworks addon, developed for the *klanglichtstrom* performance. It allows you to structure your performance like an ableton live session. 

This is a work in progress, it is sill buggy, incomplete and not yet clean. It is very likely that the codebase will change.
